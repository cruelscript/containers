# Containers

Here are implemenations of different types of containers - arrays of data. 

### Vector

A dynamic array. This implementation uses smart memory allocation.

[Fixed vector](./fixed_vector.cpp) - An Implementation of a fixed size vector.

### Hash Table 

an Associative array. Basic implementation with a simple hash function.

### Bloom Filter

Bloom filters are probabilistic space-efficient data structures. 
They are very similar to hash tables; they are used exclusively membership existence in a set. 
However, they have a very powerful property which allows to make trade-off between space and false-positive rate 
when it comes to membership existence.
